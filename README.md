## 👋 Hi, I’m @michael-lenane

I was introduced to the powers of programming by a co-worker at my first job who automated a few of their reports using VBA. That inspired me to try and do the same. The feeling of satisfaction after painstakingly piecemealing tidbits of code scoured from early 2010's VBA forums propelled me to learn more about programming. So here I am, doing my best at just that: learning.
